# Elite:Dangerous HINTWIZ Project - MS1

# Pre-development

## Functional specifications - Given by Code Institute
- LO1: Design a front end web application based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity.
- LO2: Develop and implement a static front end web application using HTML and css
- LO3: Maximize future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
- LO4: Use version control to maintain, upload and share code with developers
- LO5: Test and deploy a front end application to a cloud platform

### What this means
- Think like a user and produce a website that is easy to navigate and understand.
- Keep the backdrop from being distracting.
- Ensure the website is standard in terms of style.
- Ensure that there is accessibility even for those people who use assistive technology
- Make sure the website responds to different devices.  No point in a website that breaks when viewed on mobile.
- Static website produced using HTML (passing quality check)
- Styled using CSS and bootstrap (passing quality check)
- JavaScript not required, but can be implemented. For example, bootstrap will use JQuery.
- No Lorem ipsum text.
- Ensure this is fully documented and commented to be clear to any developer reading through.

## User stories
- As a user who has never played the game, I may want to see a trailer so that I can decide on my level of interest in the game
- As a user who has never played the game, I would like a review to know what the developer's thoughts on the game are so I can judge whether or not I want to play it.
- As a user, I want to know how to start in a new game of Elite quickly so I do not have to work out the controls for myself
- As a user, I want to know which jobs I take early on in Elite, with advantages and disadvantages of each so I can get going faster
- As a user, I want to know how different ships perform different jobs so I can spend my in game currency more effectively

# Post-Development

To access the page go to your favourite browser and type "<http://playground.golf-ladder-aqualate.net/>" into the search bar. The code is hosted at "<https://github.com/rguest20/MS1-Elite>".

### Dependencies
#### JavaScript
There are several JavaScript libraries that are required to ensure the page works, but these are included in the hosted site, so no dependencies are needed for viewing the site. For the sake of clarity, these are the JavaScript libraries that are used:
- JQuery
- JQueryUI
- Animate.js
- Popper.js

There is also some JavaScript included on the pages, but this is bespoke using the dependencies.
#### CSS
Again, several CSS dependencies are used but are included with the site, so do not need anything installing to use. Again, for the sake of clarity these dependencies are listed below:
- Bootstrap 4
- Font-Awesome 5
- Google Fonts
- JQueryUI

CSS for the pages is included in a separate stylesheet, but this is again hosted and built bespoke to extend the dependencies.

## How to use

On arrival to the page you will be presented with the following:

## UX design
To make the design more user friendly I have done the following:

## Known issues
New front page requires styling and a footer
