      <h1>ELITE:DANGEROUS
        <!--Review article-->
        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>In 1984, a relatively small company by the name of Acornsoft produced the game Elite, with wireframe graphics and some basic twitch gameplay. For it's time it was a marvel of what computing could achieve, creating a vibrant universe in
          which
          players could take on whatever role they wanted. Although basic, it proved to be enough of a hit for other games to be based on the formula and in 1993 it spawned a sequel by the name of Frontier: Elite 2. This particular specimen had a lot
          more colour, vibrancy and Newtonian physics, but still kept the core Elite experience. The universe was still open ended. It was just much bigger. There was a further sequel in 1995 called Frontier: First Encounters. This was a much more
          linear, mission based game and had a storyline that could be "beat" as opposed to it's earlier counterparts. Finally in 2014, Elite: Dangerous was created, using modern graphics and allowing many players to occupy the same universe.</p>
        <p>So, how does it stack up? I like that Elite managed to keep the feel of the original game with a wide world that you can do whatever you want in. The aesthetic is phenominal with space feeling very alive. There are a lot of other ships in
          sky and the AI will send you and itself messages. The combat is engaging and the variety on offer is brilliant. This all adds to the atmosphere. So, yes, I do think that Elite Dangerous managed to keep the feel of the first. <strong>For
            good,
            or for bad.</strong> </p>

      <p>So, lets talk about the elephant in the room, also known as the travel times.</p>
      <p>Why!?</p>
      <p>It is not unusual for some journeys to a space station to take 30 minutes or more. This is supposed to build atmosphere, but instead builds boredom. Some people play this game in VR and I can only imagine how uncomfortable you would be after
        30 minutes of flying in a straight line. Maybe I'm not the target audience, but to me, scale can be built without allowing me to go and make a cup of tea each time I travel somewhere. In fact, Elite manages the sense of scale in it's jumps
        from system to system. So why have huge amounts of time spent twiddling thumbs waiting to arrive at a space station? I suspect it is to pad out the experience until you realise something else. The whole game, the experience, the flyng around,
        is absolutely pointless. You are an ant in a garden the size of Africa. Nothing you will ever do will ever change the universe in any way. Realistic, but not going to allow me to feel epic. If I want pure realism, I have reality. I play games
        to escape that and be a fighter pilot shooting down pirates and changing the course of virtual history. This is not the experience Elite offers and I feel sad about that. Because other than that, I love it. But I'm unlikely to sink the kind
        of hours into it that I might into another game with a gripping story. And this brings me to my final thoughts. </p>
      <p> Elite is a beautiful game with lovely progression and a whole host of different objectives, but ultimately feels like a existential crisis simulator. Nothing you do matters. No-one you kill stays dead. There is no plot, no outcome that will
        captivate you. There is just saving up for a bigger ship. This is Elite's legacy and it's greatest flaw.</p>
